<h1 align ="center"> --- About --- </h1>
<p align="center">
Pettomato is a game about taking care of, and battling with, a variety of pets. How well you take care of
them affects their mood, as well as how effective they are against their opponents. Pets need consistent care
to remain happy and healthy.

Once your pet is well prepared, it can participate in battles with other pets. Winning these battles
will earn you coins, which can be spent on nurturing your pet. Items can also be used in battle to 
improve your chances of success. When your enemy is defeated, a stronger one will take its place.

Use your rewards to level up your pet and increase its strength, allowing it to defeat stronger and stronger enemies.

<p align="center">
If an enemy proves to be too strong for your pet to handle, you will be defeated. Being defeated means 
you will face a weaker enemy the next time you step in the arena.

<h1 align="center"> --- Future Plans --- </h1>
<p align="center"> 
I made this app as a fun project to teach myself about mobile app development. As such, I am not currently
planning to list this app on the Google Play store. I am currently still working on this project, although
most of the core features have already been added. At this time, the remaining core feature(s) to be added are:
</p>
<p align="center"> 
- The ability to buy and switch between different pets
</p>
<p align="center"> 
Once these core features are finished, I will continue to fix bugs and make small improvements. However, most
of the project will remain the same.
